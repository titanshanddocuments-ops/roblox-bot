# VALUE is strictly the Rolimon Value of an item, If the item has no rolimon value it has no VALUE
# Overall Value combines value and rap together to make RAP items have their RAP as the rolimon value
# Rap Algorithm takes into consideration the lows of an item and tries to determine the average price (not good for valued items)
# Important to know that Value and RAP are completely seperate, unless you use overall value.
